# OCR-Rating App (Streamlit)

Annotate cropped document snippets:
1. Rate the **image quality** (👍 😐 👎).
2. Choose which OCR output is better (GCP vs Gemini).

All ratings are stored in a tiny CSV (`app_state/ratings.csv`) so multiple
users share progress in real-time.

* **Start**: just click **“Open in Spaces”**.  
* **Data directory**: the app reads from the relative folder `data/`.
